As humans, we have limits when it comes to speed and the altitude from which we can observe, but drones are free from those constraints. I build FPV (First-Person View) drones out of passion, enabling me to explore the unknown and reach places that are otherwise inaccessible on foot.

Flying my drone at speeds exceeding 120 km/h through narrow spaces is both thrilling and challenging, and I enjoy capturing dynamic footage, whether it’s driving a car or skiing. I believe the future of FPV drones is incredibly promising, and I'm excited to be part of this evolving field.
