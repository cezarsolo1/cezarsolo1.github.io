Cooking can be broken down into three main tasks: peeling, cutting, and mixing. My goal is to create a robotic hand capable of picking and placing ingredients, as well as mixing them—whether over heat or in a bowl.

So far, I’ve developed a robotic hand that can flip pancakes, currently controlled via teleoperation. My next steps include training a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to automate this flipping task. Once successful, I plan to expand its capabilities to handle various cooking recipes.

This project represents my vision for the innovative kitchen of the future.
