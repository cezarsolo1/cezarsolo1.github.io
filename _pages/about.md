Hi, I’m Cezar Casian Solovastru, a passionate innovator and entrepreneur. Originally from a small city in Romania, I moved to Amsterdam to pursue my dream of building a successful startup that merges my love for technology and problem-solving.

Since childhood, I’ve been fascinated by electronics and software—opening up any electronic device I could find to understand how it worked. This early curiosity grew into a lifelong passion for innovation and creativity.

As a student of Artificial Intelligence, I am committed to turning bold ideas into impactful solutions. My journey has included founding companies and gaining hands-on experience in robotics, automation, and finance, including at the Bucharest Stock Exchange. These experiences have honed my skills in technology and strategy, allowing me to create meaningful change through cutting-edge solutions.

When I’m not exploring ways to automate and enhance perception for drones, I enjoy challenging myself with new projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible. I thrive on making a positive difference, one idea at a time.
